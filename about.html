          <p>
            I am Mary Epler. I am a 20 year old collage student majoring in computer science at OTC.
            After finishing at OTC in the spring of 2021, I will be transfering to MSU to complete my
            bachelor degree. If all goes a planned I will be graduating in May of 2023.
            Although I still have a long way to go in school, I have learned many programming languages
            including: Python, C++, and C#. I am also skilled in html and css. After graduating I plan
            on persuing a career in website development.
          </p>
          <p>Please check out some of my programs and websites</p>

          <h4>Work Experience</h4>
          <p>
            Although I haven't worked at a job that allows me to use my programming knowledge,
            I have tutored both math and logic, which are necessary skills to have
            when working as a programmer.

        <h3>Hobbies and More</h3>
        <p>
          In my down time I definetely enjoy relaxing and watching tv as much as anybody
          but, the kind of televition  I enjoy is definetely unique, especially for a person of my age.
          Although I do enjoy many modern movies and recently made tv shows, my true love is for romantic comedies
          made through out the late 1930s to the early 1960s and I believe that
          tv shows don't come any better than the many lovable and classic sit-coms made
          through out the eary 1950s and the 1960s.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other than television, I greatly enjoy jigsaw puzzles. I mainly work with 1000 piece
          puzzles but I have gone up to 2000 on occation. I also love diamond painting, and any other
          kind of semi scructured crafty activity.
          I am also a collector of vintage hats and have somewhat recently started a snow globe collection.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also love spending time with my amazing family, friends and pets.
          I have two cats and a puppy. I am definetely a cat person but
          the appeal of dogs certainly doesnt escape me.
