        The scenic views at Cape Cod are a must-see. There is something intrinsically
        beautiful about the ocean, and when you pair it with a sandy beach, some hills, and
        a lighthouse, it creates a breathtaking view that no picture can truly capture.
        Come to Cape Cod and take in the beauty of nature.

      <h2>About Cape Cod</h2>
      <img class ="whale" src="whale.jpg" alt="whale watching">
      <p class = "abouttext">
        Cape Cod is a hook-shaped peninsula located in Massachusetts. Cape Cod was named by Bartholomew Gosnold,
        who was an English explorer. He visited the island in 1602. Gosnold named the island Cape Cod because
        he took a large amount of codfish from the island. Today, the island is best know for its
        beautiful beaches, delicious food, and scenic views. It is also one of the best places to spot whales,
        making whale-watching a huge attraction at the Cape.
